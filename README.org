* Slides

Slides are generated using the [[https://github.com/damianavila/RISE][RISE]] project, which is a jupyter
notebook extension that can be enabled by doing 

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  jupyter-nbextension install rise --py --sys-prefix
  jupyter-nbextension enable rise --py --sys-prefix
#+END_SRC

After all the requirements are installed correctly.

* Jupyter talk material

** Ideas

- stock market analysis
- personal ledger expenses (fill up a sample about that)
- fun with maps and data representation.
  Take a map of London, some data about cost of houses and put the two things together!
- Representation of some graph database like connected people.
